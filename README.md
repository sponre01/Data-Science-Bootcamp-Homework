# Data-Science-Bootcamp-Homework
Homework for Northwestern Data Science Class Nov 2018 - May 2019

## Homework 1 - Excel
Used basic Excel functions and pivot tables to answer the following questions about given Kickstarter data:
1)	_What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?_
- Kickstarter projects in the “Theater” Parent Category are the most often attempted, and the most often successfully funded projects.
- Within the “Theater” Parent Category, projects in the subcategory “Plays” is the most attempted and successful. In fact, “Plays” is the most popular and successful subcategory overall, in any category.
- Generally, the time of year that a Kickstarter project begins does not correlate to how likely it is to be successful or to fail. (In December, there is a slight decrease in the number of successful projects relative to the total number of projects – maybe due to the holidays)

2)	_What are some of the limitations of this dataset?_
- It doesn’t include data on how quickly a project met its goal – something I think could elucidate trends in what consumers are excited to back
- I would also be interested to see the most popular “prize” donation that the project offered to compare it to the average donations – something that might show whether consumers are more likely to donate when there is the promise of a material good.

3)	_What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?_
- We could determine the length of time that a Kickstarter is active (subtracting the Date Created from the Date Ended), and correlate that to the percent funded. I would expect that the longer a kickstarter is active, the higher percentage funding it would receive.
- Similarly, we could plot the correlation between the percent funded and the number of backers the project had. I would expect more backers to correlate with a higher percentage.

## Homework 2 - VBA
VBA was used to analyze yearly stock market data for total volume, yearly change, and percent change. 
 - Includes some basic color formatting and nested loops. 
 - Source data was used for three prompts of increasing complexity - Easy, Moderate, and Hard
 - Completed for three years of data

## Homework 3 - Python
Python was used in Visual Studio Code to run some basic analysis on both financial and poll data sets.
- printed text files with the analysis results
